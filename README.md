**Telco Customer Churn Prediction Project**

This project revolves around predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company using machine learning. The project follows a structured workflow encompassing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data ingestion, transformation, validation, cleaning, model building, evaluation, and performance metrics calculation. Additionally, the model is deployed using AWS Lambda function with S3 bucket integration and GitHub Actions for automation.

**Project Overview:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** This initial phase involves exploring the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior, identify patterns, and understand the distribution of features. Visualizations and statistical analysis aid in uncovering relevant trends.

2. **Data Ingestion, Transformation, Validation, and Cleaning:** Data is ingested from various sources and undergoes transformation to ensure consistency and compatibility. Validation checks are performed to identify and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Cleaning procedures involve data preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and handling imbalanced classes.

3. **Model Building:** Machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict customer churn. Various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting are explored to identify the best-performing model.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess their effectiveness in predicting churn.

**Solution Implemented:**

The project solution comprises the following components:

- **EDA Notebook:** Contains exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and statistical summaries.
- **Data Preprocessing Script:** Performs data ingestion, transformation, validation, and cleaning tasks to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Model Building Script:** Implements machine learning algorithms, trains models, and evaluates their performance using cross-validation techniques.
- **Model Evaluation Notebook:** Calculates performance metrics and provides insights into model performance.
-
